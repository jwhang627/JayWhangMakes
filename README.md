# Jay Whang Makes Dot Com

This website is made with [ssg](https://romanzolotarev.com/ssg.html), [lowdown](https://kristaps.bsd.lv/lowdown/), and Markdown.

Yes, I am currently making the Art page now.

I will probably olesh it out more further through blogs, links to my works, and contact page with [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) and [zola](https://www.getzola.org).
