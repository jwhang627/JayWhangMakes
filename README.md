This website is made with [ssg](https://romanzolotarev.com/ssg.html), [lowdown](https://kristaps.bsd.lv/lowdown/), and Markdown.

I will probably olesh it out more further through blogs, links to my works, and contact page with [zola](https://www.getzola.org).

Currently there is a problem regarding my personal email server. Temporarily, if you need to contact, use my gmail address instead (jaywhang627@gmail.com).
