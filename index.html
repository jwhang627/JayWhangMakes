	<p class="description">
	JaeYoon "Jay" Whang is a photographer who covers events, street life, and still life pictures. Aiming for greater versatility, he works with 35mm film and DSLR formats. Whang grew up with fine paintings, art movies, genre fiction, and psychological writings. With that, he desired to show the hidden worlds in our daily lives - from the outside or the inside.
	</p>
	<p class="description">
	Whang was born in Seoul, South Korea. One of his earliest memories in Seoul was taking pictures of his neighborhood with his mother's digital camera. He and his family then moved to Columbia, Missouri, and graduated from Rock Bridge High School. Afterward, Whang attended the University of Missouri - Columbia to study computer science and graduated in 2020 with a Bachelor of Science degree. Whang later moved to New York City to study graphic design by majoring in Digital Design at the City College of New York. Being a hobbyist photographer, Whang decided to take courses in photography. And he has found a new ambition in this art field. Whang will graduate in 2023 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Digital Design. Currently, he is looking for photography jobs and expanding his portfolio by attending local events. And he is also looking for short or feature film ideas and hoping to become a film director.
