	<p class="description">
	JaeYoon "Jay" Whang is a photographer that covers events and the quotidian life on the street and takes still life pictures. Aiming for greater versatility, he works with 35mm film and DSLR formats. Whang grew up with fine paintings, cinema, and genre stories. With that, he desired to show the hidden worlds in our daily lives - from the outside or the inside.
	</p>
	<p class="description">
	Whang was born in Seoul, South Korea. One of his earliest memories in Seoul was taking pictures with his mother's digital camera. He and his family then moved to Columbia, Missouri, and graduated from Rock Bridge High School. Afterward, Whang attended the University of Missouri - Columbia to study computer science and graduated in 2020 with a Bachelor of Science. Whang later moved to New York City to study graphic design by majoring in Digital Design at the City College of New York. Being a hobbyist photographer, Whang decided to take courses in photography. And he has found a new ambition in this art field. Whang will graduate in 2023 with a Bachelor of Arts in Digital Design.
