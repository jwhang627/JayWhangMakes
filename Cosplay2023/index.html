<h1>Cosplay 2023</h1>

<div class="description">
	<p>
	These are the cosplay photos that I have taken during the year of 2023. I went to local conventions (including New York Comic-Con) and cosplayers gathering.
	
	I used DSLR camera to shoot these photos, and edited and color graded with Adobe Lightroom.
