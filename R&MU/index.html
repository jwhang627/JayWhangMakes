<h1>The Tragic End of Rodney & Madlyn U.</h1>

<div class="description">
	<p>Inspired from the short story "The Fall of the House of Usher" by Edgar Allen Poe.</p>
	
	<p>Between December 2021 and January 2022, I had some moments of melancholy and depression. I became disillusioned with my persue in graphic design industry after having a verbal fight with my typography professor. And during the winter break, I felt very burnt out by everything and suffered some imposter syndrome. At that point, I realized that I need something to leave behind before I loose myself and disappear from this world. I had an idea for the experimental short film that is made out of voice-over narrations, grotesque figures, and still images shot from various angles (based on this Japanese video art I saw from the past). After trying to think of the story, I came across this short story "The Fall of the House of Usher" by Edgar Allen Poe, it fits very with the mood I was aiming for and decided to adapt this into my film.</p>

	<p>Overall, producing such short film was a huge learning curve for me. At least I learned some aspects of casting and collaborating with actors.</p>

	<p>Then I have received some constructive responses about how depressive and boring the short film was. And this inspired me to make my next work more optimistic and empowering.</p>

	<p>Thank you all helping me to bring this alive. And also keeping myself alive while making this movie.</p>
	
	<p>It's the year 2023 and I am sharing this on the very day I was brought into this world - June 27th.</p>
