<div class="description">
	<p>
	In August 2021, I gave myself a still-life photography project. This is where I explored the three stages of a person’s life and their dualistic psyche. This topic was inspired from my teenage obsession with Sigmund Freud’s psychoanalysis. I used greyscale stock photos, two different fabric for background, some cupcakes, some colored props, and a white rose. I was interested in the idea of hidden dark side of mundane environment. And these quotidian objects were acting as symbols. I used Ricoh Singlex TLS 35mm camera, tripod, cable cord shutter release, and Ektar 100 film stocks.
